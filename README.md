* yarn `1.15.2`

## Installation

After completing the installation step, you're ready to start the project!

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|
|`build`            |Builds the application|
|`test`             |Runs unit tests |
